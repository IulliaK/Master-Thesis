# Diploma_code
To get my Master's Degree in Data Science, I wrote the code, the text, and made a presentation about using ML for humanitarian purposes. International Organisation for Migration has been conducting the Missing Migrants Project for years; the data is available at their website. I took that data and did the following:
- thorough exploratory data analysis and data visualisation;
- null values processing;
- categorical variables encoding through one-hot and man target encoding;
- machine learning for prediction (10 models in total).
